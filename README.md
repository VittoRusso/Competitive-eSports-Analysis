# League_of_Legends_Ranked_Analysis
In this project we want to understand the intrinsic differences of ranked player division and how they differ from regional play styles. The final objective is to crown a region as having the best ranked solo queue ladder, but what determines who is the best?

Day 1:
Day 1 progress: Connection to Riot's API has been establish. Basic understanding of API's functionality and params. Initial extraction of 1845 (10 pages) players per rank (excluding Master and Challenger Ranks). Player information includes the tier, rank, summonerId, summonerName, and general information about their placement.

Current milestone: Extract sufficient information from API to obtain average CS per rank for a given sample.
